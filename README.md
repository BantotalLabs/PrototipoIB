# create-react-app-sass
create-react-app with SASS

create-react-app is a fantastic tool to start applications with zero configuration


In the current version ( 0.2.1 ) does not support Sass :( 

create-react-app-sass - Sass supports files (with zero settings :D ).

How to use:

git clone https://github.com/mvarela92/create-react-app-sass
cd create-react-app-sass
npm start


happy hacking :)
