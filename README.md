# create-react-app-sass
create-react-app with SASS

create-react-app is a fantastic tool to start applications with zero configuration


In the current version ( 0.2.1 ) does not support Sass :( 

create-react-app-sass - Sass supports files (with zero settings :D ).

### How to use:

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mvarela92/create-react-app-sass
$ cd create-react-app-sass
$ npm start
```


happy hacking :)
